// What is the DOM? 

//The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

// document is present in window obj 

console.log(window.document)
console.dir(document)



// document has all the information of out html page all elements
